# SPM Notebooks

## MATLAB Live Editor

The [MATLAB Live Editor](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) allows you to create scripts that combine code, output, and formatted text in an executable notebook. See [this](https://github.com/gllmflndn/m2html/issues/4) for exporting Live Scripts (`.mlx`) into Markdown and HTML.

## Code Ocean

[Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/) is a cloud-based computational reproducibility platform, see [[1]](https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2018/11/21/code-ocean-matlab-and-sharing-reusable-code/) and [[2]](https://www.fmrwhy.com/2018/10/31/reproducible-fmri-codeocean/).

## Jupyter

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is an open source project that lets you easily combine [Markdown](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) text, executable code, persistent data, graphics, and visualizations onto a single notebook.

See [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [NBviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Jupyter kernels: [MATLAB](https://github.com/Calysto/matlab_kernel) and [Octave](https://github.com/Calysto/octave_kernel).

Jupyter notebooks can be opened in an online executable environment with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).

See also [Microsot Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/) and [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/).
